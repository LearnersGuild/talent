  "story": "I am a full-stack software engineer specializing in front-end development and JavaScript. I love playing video games and solving challenges. To me, coding is a series of solving interesting challenges. Coding is incredible, because there is no one way to solve any challenge, and I love seeing and learning how different people solve different challenges.  ",

      "projects": "I spent one year working at an after school program for middle and high school students. While there, I planned and implemented various recreational activities for students to participate in, and I provided tutoring services. I've learned that being able to teach others is an invaluable skill, and one that is crucial for a software engineer. A successful software engineer should be able to help teach others the skills they have obtained and worked hard at, as well as teach others about the code they have written."
