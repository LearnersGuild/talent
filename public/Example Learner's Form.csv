While there, I planned and implemented various recreational activities for students to participate in, and I provided tutoring services. I've learned that being able to teach others is an invaluable skill, and one that is crucial for a software engineer. A successful software engineer should be able to help teach others the skills they have obtained and worked hard at, as well as teach others about the code they have written.","No",""
